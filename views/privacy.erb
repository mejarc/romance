        <p>When you visit any page or application on the Internet, including those hosted by Two Banjos At Once, you leave certain traces behind. Here's my policy about what Two Banjos At Once does with that information.</p>
        <p>If you visit my site to read or download information on my pages, I collect and store only the following information about you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The name of the domain from which you access the Internet</li>
            <li>The date and time you access my site</li>
            <li>The Internet address of the website you used to link directly to my site.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I agree with you that you are very interesting and worth getting to know better. However, I don't seek to know anything besides what is listed above.</p>
        <p>If you identify yourself by sending me an e-mail containing personal information, I will use the information collected solely to respond to your message.</p>
        <p>I use the information collected for statistical purposes. Two Banjos At Once may use software programs to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as assessing the number of visitors to the different sections of my site, what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas.</p>
        <p>For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, Two Banjos At Once uses software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.</p>
        <p>Two Banjos At Once will not obtain personally-identifying information about you when you visit my site, unless you choose to provide such information to me. Furthermore, I will not sell or transfer such information to unaffiliated third parties without your approval at the time of collection (think of those "opt-in" checkboxes you usually leave blank).</p>
        <p>This policy immeasurably assisted by the awesome General Counsel, PC and Legal River's <a href="http://privacy-policy-generator.legalriver.com/">Privacy Policy Generator</a>.</p>
