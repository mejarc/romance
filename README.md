Your Romance Novel Author Name

*Get an eye-catching pseudonym for that trashy, best-selling romance novel you're writing to pay off your mortgage!*

A very simple Facebook divertissement, just because. JSON data shuffled and recombined, then placed gently into a text input field for users to copy and use as they please.

"Your" vs. "My"

I go back and forth on this. At present I'm tending to favor "Your," considering that the user [might be charmed](http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/social/core/yourvmy.html) to see the application reporting to her or him like a real Facebook friend (not one of those work people who friend-ed heedlessly).
