Your Romance Novel Author Name
---
Ashamed to put your real name on that potentially best-selling genre fiction you wrote last NaNoWriMo? *Generate your author name--and pay off your mortgage!*

A very simple Facebook divertissement, just because. Ruby-scraped strings from Wikipedia (thank you, Nokogiri gem), placed gently into a text input field for users to copy and use as they please.

"Your" vs. "My"
--
I go back and forth on this. At present I'm tending to favor "Your," considering that the user [might be charmed](http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/social/core/yourvmy.html) to see the application reporting to her or him like a real Facebook friend (not one of those work people who friend-ed heedlessly).
